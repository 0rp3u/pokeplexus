This application was developed for an interview code challenge using some of me most recent android
libraries and recomendations, it allows you to:

* Paginate from a list of pokemons;
* Filter the pokemon list by favorited;
* Visualize a pokemon details;
* Favorite/UnFavorte a Pokemon;
* Keeps your favorited pokemon local so you can view then anytime;
* Strong networking model that lets you keep using the application when you don't have connection;
